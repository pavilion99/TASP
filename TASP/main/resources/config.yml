# ====================================WELCOME TO TASP====================================
# That Awesome Spigot Plugin is designed to make your life easier by providing for you
# many commands that should be essential to any server that, for some reason, have not
# yet been implemented by the Spigot platform.
#
# Although many of the commands implemented by TASP are indeed present in other plugins,
# the main goal of TASP is to combine these commands and features in a more cohesive,
# up-to-date way.
#
# This plugin is highly customizable but that does not mean in any way that it is not for
# the faint-of-heart.  The plugin is designed to be incredibly user friendly.  It works
# out-of-the-box, no setup required, but also contains a myriad of configuration settings
# for those who wish to make it their own.  Should you find yourself lost in config 
# files,
# "Ctrl+F" (or "Command+F") is definitely your friend :)
# 
# TASP is developed and maintained by Minecraft user pavilion99 (whose name will never
# change, but in the event that it does, his UUID is 
# c6e3040f-1288-4a1b-a59c-44fbf248931c)
#
# Please shoot me an email at me@spencercolton.tech to inform me of issues in my 
# software!
#
# This open-source project is lovingly hosted on GitHub 
# (https://github.com/pavilion99/TASP)
#
# Let's get to the fun stuff, shall we?

# ║                              BASIC TASP CUSTOMIZATIONS                              ║

# Let's make this thing pretty!  Setup your colors here.  The primary color is used in 
# the static part of any message (Your home was set to) and the secondary color is used
# for the parts that change (x y z).
# Acceptable colors: AQUA, BLACK, BLUE, DARK_AQUA, DARK_BLUE, DARK_GRAY, DARK_GREEN,
#                    DARK_PURPLE, DARK_RED, GOLD, GRAY, GREEN, LIGHT_PURPLE, RED, WHITE
#                    YELLOW
# Defaults:
#   primary-color: GOLD
#   secondary-color: DARK_RED
#   error-color: RED
primary-color: 'GOLD'
secondary-color: 'DARK_RED'
error-color: 'RED'
# Don't get sneaky and try to use things like BOLD, ITALIC, MAGIC, RESET, STRIKETHROUGH, 
# and UNDERLINE! The game code will default them to GOLD for the primary color and 
# DARK_RED for the secondary color.
#
# ═════════════════════════════════Transparency Settings═════════════════════════════════
# Sometimes, you want the players to feel all at home and cozy with their commands.
# Sometimes, you don't want the players to see any response at all after they run a
# command.  In this case, you can change what commands display a message here.
# Certain commands can be run on other people by players with higher permissions.  These
# commands can be set to only send a message to nobody, only the person that ran the
# command, or to both the person who ran the command and the person that it affected.
# The governing of this is as follows:
# command: true if messages are to be sent, false if not
# command.others: true if messages are to be sent to who was affected, false if not
# For example:
#   setspeed: true
#   setspeed.others: false
# Any person who runs the setspeed command will receive a message, but if that person
# used "setspeed" on another player (/setspeed [otherplayer]), that "otherplayer" will 
# not receive a message that their speed has been changed.
# By default, all messages are turned on.
command-messages:
    setspeed: true
    setspeed.others: true
    
    killall: true
    
    fly: true
    fly.others: true
    
    home: true
    
    sethome: true
    sethome.others: true
    
    god: true
    god.others: true
#
# ═════════════════════════════════Message Customization═════════════════════════════════
# (Almost) any message that is displayed in-game can be changed here.  Because most 
# messages have parts that are variable, the variables that can be moved or eliminated
# are shown above each command.  You'll get the hang of it, I promise.  Hang in there!
# For each command, {0} is equivalent to the primary text color that you set above, and
# {1} is the secondary text color that you set above.  So, in case you don't know
# anything about Minecraft formatting, whereever you put the {0}, text will start being
# that color, and it won't stop being that color until you put a {1}, or vice versa.
command-message-text:
    # {2}: The new speed.
    setspeed: '{0} Your speed was set to {1} {2} {0}.'
    # {2}: The player whose speed was changed
    # {3}: Their new speed
    setspeed.others.s: '{1} {2}{1}''s speed was set to {1} {3} {0}.'
    # {2}: The new speed.
    # {3}: The person who set the new speed.
    setspeed.others.r: '{0} Your speed was set to {1} {2} {0} by {1} {3}.'
