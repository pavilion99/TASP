# |                                   WELCOME TO TASP                                   |
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# That Awesome Spigot Plugin is designed to make your life easier by providing for you
# many commands that should be essential to any server that, for some reason, have not
# yet been implemented by the Spigot platform.

# Although many of the commands implemented by TASP are indeed present in other plugins,
# the main goal of TASP is to combine these commands and features in a more cohesive,
# up-to-date way.

# This plugin is highly customizable but that does not mean in any way that it is not for
# the faint-of-heart.  The plugin is designed to be incredibly user friendly.  It works
# out-of-the-box, no setup required, but also contains a myriad of configuration settings
# for those who wish to make it their own.  Should you find yourself lost in config
# files, "Ctrl+F" (or "Command+F") is definitely your friend :)

# TASP is developed and maintained by Minecraft user pavilion99 (whose name will never
# change, but in the event that it does, his UUID is
# c6e3040f-1288-4a1b-a59c-44fbf248931c)

# Please shoot me an email at me@spencercolton.tech to inform me of issues in my
# software!

# This open-source project is lovingly hosted on GitHub
# (https://github.com/pavilion99/TASP)

# Let's get to the fun stuff, shall we?

# Sometimes, you want the players to feel all at home and cozy with their commands.
# Sometimes, you don't want the players to see any response at all after they run a
# command.  In this case, you can change what commands display a message here.
# Certain commands can be run on other people by players with higher permissions.  These
# commands can be set to only send a message to nobody, only the person that ran the
# command, or to both the person who ran the command and the person that it affected.
# The governing of this is as follows:
# command: true if messages are to be sent, false if not
# command.others: true if messages are to be sent to who was affected, false if not
# For example:
#   setspeed: true
#   setspeed-others: false
# Any person who runs the setspeed command will receive a message, but if that person
# used "setspeed" on another player (/setspeed [otherplayer]), that "otherplayer" will
# not receive a message that their speed has been changed.
# By default, all messages are turned on.

# For each command, {0} is equivalent to the primary text color that you set above, and
# {1} is the secondary text color that you set above.  So, in case you don't know
