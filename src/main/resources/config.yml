# |                                   WELCOME TO TASP                                   |
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# That Awesome Spigot Plugin is designed to make your life easier by providing for you
# many commands that should be essential to any server that, for some reason, have not
# yet been implemented by the Spigot platform.

# Although many of the commands implemented by TASP are indeed present in other plugins,
# the main goal of TASP is to combine these commands and features in a more cohesive,
# up-to-date way.

# This plugin is highly customizable but that does not mean in any way that it is not for
# the faint-of-heart.  The plugin is designed to be incredibly user friendly.  It works
# out-of-the-box, no setup required, but also contains a myriad of configuration settings
# for those who wish to make it their own.  Should you find yourself lost in config
# files, "Ctrl+F" (or "Command+F") is definitely your friend :)

# TASP is developed and maintained by Minecraft user pavilion99 (whose name will never
# change, but in the event that it does, his UUID is
# c6e3040f-1288-4a1b-a59c-44fbf248931c)

# Please shoot me an email at me@spencercolton.tech to inform me of issues in my
# software!

# This open-source project is lovingly hosted on GitHub
# (https://github.com/pavilion99/TASP)

# Let's get to the fun stuff, shall we?

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Let's make this thing pretty!  Setup your colors here.  The primary color is used in
# the static part of any message (Your home was set to) and the secondary color is used
# for the parts that change (x y z).
# Acceptable colors: AQUA, BLACK, BLUE, DARK_AQUA, DARK_BLUE, DARK_GRAY, DARK_GREEN,
#                    DARK_PURPLE, DARK_RED, GOLD, GRAY, GREEN, LIGHT_PURPLE, RED, WHITE

# Don't get sneaky and try to use things like BOLD, ITALIC, MAGIC, RESET, STRIKETHROUGH,
# and UNDERLINE! The game code will reset them to their defaults.

# How long should it take before a player is labeled "afk," in minutes?  Set to 0 for no limit.
afk-timeout: 10

# When a player runs /broadcast, what should the prefix of their message be?
broadcast-prefix: NOTICE

# When a player runs /helpme, what should the prefix of their message be?
helpme-prefix: HELPME

# When someone runs /info about a player, what statistics about that player should be shown?
# Available includes: DISPLAY_NAME, HEALTH, FOOD, XP, LOCATION, GAMEMODE, GOD, STALKER, AFK, MUTED, FLYING, FOM,
#                     BUDDHA, IP
info-includes: [DISPLAY_NAME, HEALTH, FOOD, XP, LOCATION, GAMEMODE, GOD, STALKER, AFK, MUTED, FLYING, FOM, BUDDHA, IP]

# If someone chooses to burn a player without specifying a time, how long should that player burn (in seconds)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TASP has the option for being used on more complex servers such as server networks that
# run BungeeCord (though this is not required; any two servers can be linked through an
# instance of TASPRouter).  For most people, these settings can be safely ignored,
# because improperly setting these options may result in the server being rendered
# inoperable.

# Enable or disable the linking of TASP instances
router-enabled: false

# TASP commands are divided into three groups: singular, global, and universal.
# Singular commands are commands that don't affect other players or the world at large,
# they only affect the person that runs the command.
# Global commands are commands that can affect up to everyone on that server, but cannot
# have any effect on other servers in the network.
# Universal commands can and often do have effects on other players in the network.

# Singular Commands:
# back, craft, drops, enchant, explode, holding, home, item, jump, killall, powertool
# recipe, sethome, setspawn, setwarp, shoot, sign, spawn, spawner, spawnmob, top, xyz

# Global Commands:
# me, mute, srvinfo, stahp, tploc, time, weather

# Universal Commands:
# block, helpme, info, invspy, kick, mail, message, nick, ptt, r, su, tpa, tp, tpd, tphere
# tprhere, tpr, tpt, unblock, world

# This is not all of the commands.  Many commands fall under "dual-modality," meaning that
# they can act either as a Global command or as a Universal command.  These include:
# afk, antidote, broadcast, buddha, burn, clear, disappear, feed, fly, fom, gamemode,
# god, heal, hurt, kill, potion, setspeed, shock, stalker, starve, tasp, tpahere, tpar,
# warp, warps, xp

# To further customize the experience of having two server interconnected, server owners
# are able to choose the mode that this server will run in.  There are currently three
# options:
# 'seamless':  The server will any requests for resources not available on this server,
# such as players, and those server respond appropriately. All dual-modality commands
# will run as 'universal.'
# 'independent': The server will still be connected to the router, but some requests that
# could be handled network-level will be handled locally.  All dual-modality commands
# will run as 'global.'
integration-level: seamless

# Set the name of this server so that players can be routed between servers using commands.
# If this server is part of a BungeeCord network, it is strongly recommended that this
# server's name be set to the same name as how it identifies on the network.
router-client-name: TASPServer1

# To prevent any malicious third-parties from viewing what goes on on the servers, it is
# required that each client have a password that is defined in the config.yml file of the
# TASPRouter server.  Furthermore, this password has to align with an IP address.  Enter
# the password that has been set for the server at this IP here.
# PLEASE CHANGE THIS PASSWORD!
router-password: password

# Give an IP address or domain name pointing to the active instance of TASPRouter.
router-host: localhost

# Provide the port that the TASPRouter instance is listening on.
router-port: 1717

# Besides these configuration options, you can set the server to ask for configuration
# from a database rather than from configuration files so that TASP can operate
# similarly across instances.  THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PLAYER DATA FILES!
# NOTE: If you have already run the server with this set to 'false' and your player data
# is stored in separate 'JSON' files, there is currently no automated way to transfer player
# data.  This features is coming soon.
use-config-database: true

# Set this to true if your configuration database is separate from the punishment database.
# This setting must be true if punishments are stored via JSON.
separate-config-database: false

# The following five settings are ignored if the above setting is "false"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TASP has a built-in punishment system that works on bans, temporary bans, kicks, and
# muting.
# How should these punishments be dealt?  There are two options: one commmand, 'punish',
# that leaves little choice to moderaters.  The punish command works by allowing the
# punisher to specify only a player and a reason in the form "/punish <player> <reason>".
# In the configuration, you, the server owner, can specify a list of reasons such as
# "hackusations," "advertising," or "disrespect."  Attached to each of these is a default
# punishment, therefore the moderators have little thinking to do.
# punishment-method: punish

# This arrangement, however, is not appealing to all servers.  Many would prefer to afford
# their moderators a bit more say in the matter.  In this case, the standard commands can
# be applied (/ban, /kick, /gmute, etc.)
punishment-method: standard

# How should punishments be stored?  For most servers, punishments can be stored in a JSON
# file easily.  However, for networked servers, it is necessary that punishments be stored
# in a database (the server will fail to start if this is improperly configured).
punishment-storage: JSON
# punishment-storage: database

# For database-based storage:
punishment-database-host: localhost
punishment-database-port: 3306
punishment-database-username: tasp
punishment-database-password: password
punishment-database-db: tasp_punishments

# Here are the owner-defined punishments.  Only apply if punishment-method is set to "punish"
punishments:
  DISRESPECT: [kick, mute 30]
  RACISM: [kick, mute 30]
  DEATH_THREATS: [mute 10080, mute inf]
  INAPPROPRIATE_COMMENTS: [mute 20]

# Sometimes, you want the players to feel all at home and cozy with their commands.

# command.others: true if messages are to be sent to who was affected, false if not
# For example:
#   setspeed: true
#   setspeed-others: false
